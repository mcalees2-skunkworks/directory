The more variety there is in your diet, the more diverse the colonies of bacteria are in your gut.

Waking up at the end of a ninety minute interval ensures that you are refreshed. To wake up refreshed, sleep for one of the following times:</p>\n<p><img src=\"http://gdblogs.shu.ac.uk/b2006900/wp-content/uploads/sites/15/2014/10/sleep-cycle1.gif\" alt=\"source: sleepsync.com\"></p>\n<p>â€‹ <em>source: sleepsync.com</em></p>\n<ul>\n<li>5 x 90 minutes = 450 minutes = 7.5 hours</li>\n<li>4 x 90 minutes = 360 minutes = 6 hours</li>\n<li>3 x 90 minutes = 270 minutes = 4.5 hours</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Note: each of the times above states the amount of time spent asleep not in bed.
