# money

-The simplest and most important principle of finance is to spend less than you earn. To do this, increase your income if possible and look for new ways to cut costs. Focus on the big costs. -You want to have the highest standard of living at the lowest cost. In other words, maximize the ratio of value to cost.

## The Big Picture

* What really matters is what you do in your life. Money only provides

  the means to do what you want to do.

## Tips

* Spend money generously on things you use regularly: smartphones, laptops and clothes. They provide a lot of value because you use them regularly.

  These things may seem expensive when you buy them but when you spread the cost out over say a year, the cost is tiny.

* Example: a €365 smartphone only costs €1 per day if you use it for a year.
* Be wary of small regular expenses such as eating at restaurants. These costs add up quickly if you spend money

  on them everyday.

* The relationship between spending and happiness has diminishing returns. Making sure that you aren't poor is the most important thing.

## Focus on the big expenses

* Don't be penny smart and dollar foolish.
* The big expenses: 
  1. Housing
  2. Education \(very expensive in some countries\)
  3. Car / transport
  4. Utilities
* Manage the big expenses well and ignore small expenses unless they are regular. Tracking tiny expenses is not worth the time and effort

  unless you are really poor. Remember the big picture.

## Housing

Factors to consider:

* How much are you willing to spend?

    -This depends on your income.

    -living at home has the lowest cost as you only have to pay for transport. There is no extra rent.

  -Time

    -How much time do you spend on transport? How much of that time is wasted per day?

* What home work setup do you want if you do some of your work at home?

    -Ideally have a good desk and chair in a quiet environment. What matters most is that there are no distractions.

* How nice does the area have to be?

    -Crime free and with at least a neutral atmosphere.

* How much space do you need in your room?

    -enough to contain all your posessions in an organized way.

  -Amenities

    -proximity to shopping centers, parks, gyms.

  -People

    -How many people do you want to live with, if any, and who?
