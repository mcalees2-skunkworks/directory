So far though, I&#39;ve gained insights only through much mental effort. Recently however, I feel I&#39;ve developed enough of a understanding of many philosophical problems to make faster progress.</p>\n<p>My progress seems to be following an S-curve and I think I&#39;m approaching the middle of the curve. I expect to see diminishing returns soon so I&#39;ll begin concrete planning and execution as opposed to only thinking about things.</p>\n<p>Also, I think I have been more open to new ideas and less mentally rigid in the past month which is an improvement.</p>\n<p><strong>Next month</strong>: clarify your understanding of the source of values and motivation. Solve the direction problem or what you should do. Then create a guide for how to live, and a personal life plan. If you fail to make progress on these philosophical issues or are progressing too slowly, just start executing a backup life plan which you can then refine over time.</p>\n<p>I feel a sense of urgency about solving the problems above. Solving these problems is merely a means to an end where the end is the achievement of goals. Therefore, I need to solve these problems soon. I also think the insights I gain will be valuable to other people who are unsure about what to do.</p>\n<h2 id=\"directory\">Directory</h2>\n<p> Make the core section highly compact. This will ensure that I can edit everything and that I have only very high quality content there. </p>\n<p>Write about only the most general and valuable ideas. I think there is a limited supply of these so I expect the number of contributions I make to directory to decrease over time.</p>\n<h2 id=\"lifestyle\">Lifestyle</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m beginning to appreciate the importance of living a more balanced life. I think I can live a more varied lifestyle with a low impact to my productivity if I manage my time well and work efficiently.</p>\n<p><strong>Social life</strong>: spend more time with people.</p>\n<p><strong>College</strong>: I&#39;ve been getting my work done more quickly which is good.</p>\n<p><strong>Reading</strong>: I&#39;ve realized that thinking is a better use of my time than reading so I&#39;m reducing the amount of time I spend reading. Though bear in mind that the knowledge your acquire from reading supports good thinking. So read a little bit everyday.</p>\n<p><strong>Sleep</strong>: go to bed earlier.</p>\n<p><strong>Diet</strong>: eat a more varied diet and eat more calories.</p>\n<p><strong>mindset</strong>: focus on improving over being competent. Be more open to flaws and failure because they are opportunities to improve. Have more of a growth mindset instead of a fixed mindset.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/plans/reviews/jan","name":"Jan","parent":"home/plans/reviews","contents":"<h1 id=\"january-2019-review\">January 2019 Review</h1>\n<p>This is a description of how I am progressing towards my goals for 2019.</p>\n<h2 id=\"1-philosophy\">1. Philosophy</h2>\n<h3 id=\"reflection\">Reflection</h3>\n<p>I have recently been thinking about the direction I want my life to take. To figure out which direction I should take, I have been thinking about the nature of value and what we value collectively.</p>\n<p>I feel like I&#39;ve made some progress on understanding value and which futures would be desirable though I still have a high degree of uncertainty about some issues.</p>\n<h3 id=\"what-to-start-and-stop-and-continue-doing\">What to Start and Stop and Continue Doing</h3>\n<p>Reading more about related ideas would help inspire creativity and speed up progress as many of the problems I am thinking about have probably already been solved. Spending more time thinking about these issues would also help me to solve them more quickly.</p>\n<p>I would like to stop getting distracted by narrow questions and ideas so that I can focus on the more general questions that apply to all future situations.</p>\n<p>Going forward, I want to continue thinking about problems related to value. I want to spend more time thinking about these problems because the impact of solving them is high - they only really need to be solved once and they underpin everything that we value. Although many of these problems are difficult, such as whether value accumulates across time, any progress would be highly beneficial because of the importance of the problems and because our intuitive understanding of these problems may be poor.</p>\n<h3 id=\"plan\">Plan</h3>\n<p>Next month I would like to spend more time thinking about fundamental questions about value because the importance of these problems probably dwarfs anything else I would think about. By the end of next month, I want to have a good enough understanding of the value landscape that I can clearly explain my ideas in an essay.</p>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.bd1d042d.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.4d41f4ed.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.1f3d5f95.js"></script></body></html>
