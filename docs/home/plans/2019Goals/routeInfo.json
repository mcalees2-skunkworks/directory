Philosophy, deadline: end of February</h2>\n<p>I want to think carefully about what I value so that achieving my goals has the greatest positive effect. This goal is my top priority because success is a vector - it has a magnitude and a direction, and choosing the direction is the hard part. It&#39;s not enough to go somewhere. You have to go in the right direction otherwise you could end up like a soldier accidentally fighting for the wrong side - trying hard put not achieving your values. My goal is to find the most important values and plot my future course to achieve those values.</p>\n<p>Ignoring the problem of what to value is not a solution. Whether the problem is solved or not, there will be real moral consequences to our actions. Neglecting this problem is probably ethically wrong because that would result in our actions having less of a positive effect on the world. Ignorance is not acceptable if you have the choice to remedy it.</p>\n<h2 id=\"2-create-a-long-term-plan-based-on-what-you-discover-above-deadline-\">2.
