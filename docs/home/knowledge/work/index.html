<p>The direction you choose for you career matters more than how hard you work. You have to make choices and trade-offs because you don't have enough time to have many careers. The rational thing to do in response to this problem is to choose the best option based on whatever criteria you care about. Personally, I want to work on the areas that will most affect the future of civilization such as artificial intelligence.</p>

<p>Small improvements in productivity per day can translate into huge differences in the long term. For example, saving ten minutes per day adds up to sixty hours of saved time per year.</p>

Excellence, then, is not an act, but a habit.” - Will Durant</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Habits enable you to be more reliably productive because they make productivity automatic. To understand why consistency is important, consider the fact that you would be twice as productive if you did something everyday instead of every second day.</p>\n<p>You can acquire the consistency needed for high productivity if you create good habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"how-to-create-habits\">How to Create Habits</h2>\n<p>James Clear outlines in his book &#39;Atomic Habits&#39; that to create a habit, the activity must be:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>obvious, attractive, easy, and satisfying</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Habits have a distinctive pattern involving three elements: </p>\n<ul>\n<li>a cue, a routine and a reward</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The cue for a habit could be a certain time or place. At first, you have to consciously follow the cue with a routine and a reward. After many repetitions, the cue will create a craving for a reward which compels you to carry out the routine. The trick is to make sure the routine is something you want to be doing such as work as it&#39;s also possible to create bad habits.</p>\n<h2 id=\"example\">Example</h2>\n<p>For example, if you want to get into the habit of reading before bed, the cue could be when you finish brushing your teeth, the routine is reading and the reward is the sense of accomplishment you have from executing the habit successfully.</p>\n<p>How to make it:</p>\n<p><strong>obvious:</strong> specify exactly what you want to do. In this case, you want to read.</p>\n<p><strong>attractive</strong>: read something you are interested in. If you have to read something, an external factor such as music can make the habit more attractive.</p>\n<p><strong>easy</strong>: make the habit short and easy to complete. Then you can increase the difficulty over time.</p>\n<p><strong>satisfying</strong>: have a reward at the end. Often, this can be a sense of accomplishment.</p>\n<h2 id=\"habit-tracking\">Habit Tracking</h2>\n<p>I&#39;m using an app called Boosted to track how much time I spend on activities I want to be doing. The app allows you to start a timer for a certain activity. This acts as the cue. The routine is the work and the reward is the sense of accomplishment I feel when I see that I&#39;ve spent time on a productive activity.</p>\n","folder":0},{"path":"home/knowledge/work/productivityProjection","name":"Productivity Projection","parent":"home/knowledge/work","contents":"<h3 id=\"how-small-changes-now-become-big-changes-later\">How Small Changes Now Become Big Changes Later</h3>\n<p>Small changes in our daily routines may not seem significant, but these changes add up over time and have a  strong influence on which future we end up with.</p>\n<p>For example, saving one euro per day for a few years results in a sum of hundreds of Euro after a few years. The same principle applies to learning and productivity.</p>\n<p>Highly knowledgeable or accomplished people didn&#39;t instantly become that way. Instead, they learned or achieved a little bit more than everyone else per day resulting in them being far ahead after a long period of time.</p>\n<p>Our lives are like projections of our daily routines. Just as a fly landing on a projector lens could ruin a movie, small but wasteful activities per day can be very damaging over the long term. Wasting a few minutes here and there carelessly everyday really matters in the long term. The same applies for small positive activities - for example, consistent little jumps of progress everyday can become huge achievements in the long term. Laying a brick everyday results in a wall after enough time.</p>\n<p>To get the best possible future, it&#39;s important to see the significance of short but routine activities and not to fall into the trap of thinking that they&#39;re unimportant. We should be more afraid of small time-wasting activities and take small, positive habits more seriously.</p>\n","folder":0}]},"siteData":{"title":"React Static"}};</script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/bootstrap.bd1d042d.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/templates/src/containers/Note.4d41f4ed.js"></script><script defer="" type="text/javascript" src="/main.1f3d5f95.js"></script></body></html>
