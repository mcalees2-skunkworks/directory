The more variety there is in your diet, the more diverse the colonies of bacteria are in your gut. The bacteria in your gut are thought to influence your mental health so it is important to eat a variety of fiber-rich foods. Huel is a somewhat monotonous food so I eat other fiber-rich foods to increase the variety in my diet.</li>\n<li>Tooth decay: our teeth evolved to chew on tough plants and meat which scraped food from our teeth. Huel tends to stick to your teeth which could cause tooth decay if your teeth are not cleaned regularly. To prevent tooth decay, I ensure that I brush my teeth twice per day. I also drink water throughout the day so that my teeth are cleaner.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>On balance, Huel has definitely had a net positive effect on my life, mainly due to the fact that it saves time spent on cooking everyday.
