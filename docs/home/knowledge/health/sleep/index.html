<p>Sleeping regular hours is important - I try to go to bed and wake up at the same time.</p>
<p>Its generally a good idea to keep your sleep schedule roughly in sync with the sun where you wake up around sunrise and go to bed after the sun has set. Animals have evolved over the past 500 million years to function in sync with the natural daylight cycle. Therefore it makes sense to sleep that way for optimal health.</p>
<p>I usually get around 8 hours of sleep. I find that to be an optimal balance between saving time and being well-rested.</p>
<p>I try to wake up after a certain multiple of ninety minute intervals since sleep is made up of ninety minute cycles. Waking up at the end of a ninety minute interval ensures that you are refreshed. To wake up refreshed, sleep for one of the following times:</p>

<ul>
<li>5 x 90 minutes = 450 minutes = 7.5 hours</li>
<li>4 x 90 minutes = 360 minutes = 6 hours</li>
<li>3 x 90 minutes = 270 minutes = 4.5 hours</li>
</ul>
<p>Note: each of the times above states the amount of time spent asleep not in bed. Add roughly 20 minutes to each of the times above to account for the fact that it takes some time to fall asleep.</p>
