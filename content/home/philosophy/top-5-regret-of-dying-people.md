# Top Five Regrets of the Dying

1. "I wish I had the courage of to live a life true to myself, not the life others expected of me."
2. "I wish I hadn't worked so hard."
3. "I wish that I had the courage to express my feelings."
4. "I wish I had stayed in touch with friends."
5. "I wish I had let myself be happier."
