# Directory

Directory is a collection of my thoughts, ideas, plans and knowledge.

## Purpose

Directory acts as a guide for my actions. My memory is too small for everything I need to know so I'm using Directory to store my most useful ideas, knowledge and values which I can use to make better decisions.

Thinking about your life consciously is difficult but any effort in this direction is better than none.

I've open-sourced Directory because I believe that knowledge is usually most valuable when shared among as many individuals as possible - sharing knowledge has almost no cost and can be highly beneficial.

## Technology

Directory runs on React, but compiles down to Javascript and is served as static files on Github.

## Other

Directory was created in February 2019

Directory is inspired by [Gytis Daujotas's Directory](https://directory.gytis.co)
