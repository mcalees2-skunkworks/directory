# Style Guide

### General

Clarify your thinking before you write. Then write clearly and concisely.

Avoid saying "I think" or similar phrases to for conciseness. It's implied that everything in directory is your own opinion.

Focus on quality over quantity.

### Addition

Adding to directory takes time so only add particularly useful information. New additions also make editing the whole of directory more difficult.

Only add something to Directory if all the conditions below are true:

1. It can't easily be found on the internet.
2. It is more useful in a written form than in your mind.
3. It's important.

### Deletion

Removing content is useful because it makes editing the whole of Directory easier. 

### Editing 

Editing is very important. It allows you to continually improve your ideas over time while saving the result. The process of editing and saving creates a much better product than a first single draft ever could.
