## Advice

Sleep regular hours - stick to a sleep schedule

Keep your sleep hours roughly in line with the sun

Sleep for a multiple of 90 minute intervals (eg. 4 x 90 mins or 5 x 90 mins)

Assuming eight hours of sleep, the graph below suggests that I should go to bed at around 12:30 am and wake up at 8:30 am
