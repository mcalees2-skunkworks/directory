## Break Down Work Into Small Pieces

Our willpower is usually weaker than emotional resistance. The balance can be moved in favor of willpower by breaking large tasks into smaller subtasks. Subtasks require less willpower because they are shorter and easier and cause less emotional resistance because they are less daunting. Create subtasks to beat procrastination and fatigue.

It's possible to do ordinary work everyday and achieve extraordinary results in the long term because the work builds up over time. To achieve extraordinary results, consistency is important. Lowering the activation energy required to do work by making work easier to start fosters consistency. For example, you could leave your laptop open on your desk so that you can easily start working on it at any time.

## Choose What You Want to Work on Carefully

The direction you choose for you career matters more than how hard you work. You have to make choices and trade-offs because you don't have enough time to have many careers.

So think about it more! Independent thought is hard but it’s something you can get better at with practice." -_ [_Productivity_](http://blog.samaltman.com/productivity)_, Sam Altman_
