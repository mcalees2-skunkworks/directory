### How Small Changes Now Become Big Changes Later

Small changes in our daily routines may not seem significant, but these changes add up over time and have a  strong influence on which future we end up with.

For example, saving one euro per day for a few years results in a sum of hundreds of Euro after a few years. The same principle applies to learning and productivity.

Highly knowledgeable or accomplished people didn't instantly become that way. Instead, they learned or achieved a little bit more than everyone else per day resulting in them being far ahead after a long period of time.

Our lives are like projections of our daily routines. Just as a fly landing on a projector lens could ruin a movie, small but wasteful activities per day can be very damaging over the long term. Wasting a few minutes here and there carelessly everyday really matters in the long term. The same applies for small positive activities - for example, consistent little jumps of progress everyday can become huge achievements in the long term. Laying a brick everyday results in a wall after enough time.

To get the best possible future, it's important to see the significance of short but routine activities and not to fall into the trap of thinking that they're unimportant. We should be more afraid of small time-wasting activities and take small, positive habits more seriously.
