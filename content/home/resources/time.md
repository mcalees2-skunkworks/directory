A 40 year career is less than 15,000 days which isn't that many days. Think about how short a day is. When you multiply something relatively small by something small, you get something small. Therefore, life is short.

We live as if we will live forever but our time is probably limited. We live as if each day as if tomorrow is a renewal of today. The reality is that yesterday is not an old version of today. Yesterday is gone and every day spent is gone forever.

## What To Do

Since time is more valuable than we think, we should have a greater sense of urgency. Live as if there will be no tomorrow. Don't procrastinate. Cut out things in your life which don't provide much value. For me, I've found texting to sometimes be a waste of time. Set clear goals and go after them.

As humans, we tend to be reactive. We lose something and then resolve to fix the problem. With time, this is not an option. Time wasted can never be renewed. Therefore there is a cost to being reactive. A better approach is to take a proactive approach - spend time carefully regardless of your past experience.
