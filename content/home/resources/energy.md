It is not common for people to take into account their supply of mental and physical energy.

I find that I'm most productive when I work in short bursts since small breaks allow me to re-energize.

It's well known that your energy levels decrease as you age. Therefore I think it's wise to do things that require a lot of energy while you're young.
