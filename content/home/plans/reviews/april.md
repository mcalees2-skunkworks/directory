# Work 

Last month I planned to learn more programming and build more things. Unfortunately, I don't think I've learned new things as fast as I could have. I think this happened because I didn't spend enough time on programming.

**Next month**: In the future, learn by doing and breaking down skills into sub-skills should accelerate my rate of learning. Build as many new things as possible as practice. Spend more time on programming.

# Relationships

My social life has been fine. 

**Next month:** Continue to reach out to existing friends and make more friends.

# Experiences

I probably could have had more new experiences in the past month. April has passed by fairly quickly and the reason why is possibly because you haven't had many new experiences.

**Next month**: Make an effort to have travel more and have new experiences.

# Other

I'd like to get into the habit of meditating everyday to calm my mind and increase focus.
