# 1. Work

I value achievement and I believe work adds meaning to life. It's not enough to be happy in the short term. It's also important to have long term satisfaction, meaning and direction.

# 2. Relationships

The quality of your relationships is strongly correlated with your level of happiness.

Build relationships that are as meaningful as possible. Focus on quality over quantity.

Real life interaction is way more valuable than online interaction in general.

Lower your expectations for your social life to reduce loneliness.

# 3. Experience

First experiences seem to be particularly valuable suggesting that experiences have diminishing returns. For example, seeing a place ten times is much less than ten times as valuable as seeing the place once.
