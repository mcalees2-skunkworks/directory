# 1. Work

I value achievement and I believe work adds meaning to life. I don't think it's enough to be happy in the short term. It's important to have long term satisfaction, meaning and direction.

## Maximize Output

- programming: create useful applications. Focus on providing value.
- directory
  - planning: clarify where you want end up in a few years
  - figure out how to live the best life possible
  - philosophy

## Maximize Input

- college work
- Machine Learning course on Coursera
- reading: increase your knowledge base as much as possible
- learning programming

# 2. Relationships

The quality of your relationships is strongly correlated with your level of happiness.

Build relationships that are as meaningful as possible. Focus on quality over quantity.

Real life interaction is way more valuable than online interaction in general.

Lower your expectations for your social life to reduce loneliness.

# 3. Experience

First experiences seem to be particularly valuable suggesting that experiences have diminishing returns. For example, seeing a place ten times is much less than ten times as valuable as seeing the place once.

New experiences slow down the perception of time and make the past seem more 'full' in retrospect.

# Time Division

I intend to spend most of my time on work. 40% output, 40% input, %10 on relationships and 10% on experiences sounds like a good split. Though I'll modify these ratios based on future experience.
