# How to Avoid Decision Paralysis

When you think about what to do with your live, decision paralysis can take hold. It's difficult to know what to do when there are so many possibilities. For example, there are hundreds of careers to choose from so how do you choose one?

I think it's important to avoid what I call the trap of opportunity cost. We often know what we want to do but forgo doing it because we know there could be a better option. That is the trap at play. 

Instead, focus on making your life as good as possible. Have the goal of improving your life rather than avoiding opportunity cost.

The reason why is that the opportunity cost trap is fundamentally self-defeating. You will never attain perfection so stop trying. Just keep making your life better and accept that there are always going to be flaws in your life.
