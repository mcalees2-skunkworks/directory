Observing negative emotions in detached way tends to blunt them. To do this, say to yourself, "I'm feel..." followed by whatever emotion you are feeling.

Taking deep breaths helps to reduce stress.

## Stoicism

To be happier, learn to want what your already have.

Don't try and control things you can't control. 

Foster a sense of control over the things you can control in your life. Experiments have shown that animals have the ability to extinguish stress when they feel in control over their situation.

Imagine the things and people you take for granted and interact with the most would suddenly vanish and be gone forever. Thisâ€™ll make you feel bad at first, but then you will be filled with gratitude.
